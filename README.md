# Traffic Signal Kit

Welcome to the Traffic Signal Kit! This project is a learning journey into Vue.js with a focus on building practical traffic signal-related tools. These tools were built fast to serve as proof of concepts, showcasing different Vue.js features and techniques while providing a useful tool related to traffic signals.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Traffic Signal Kit is to provide simple tools for traffic engineers while I learn Vue.js. By focusing on traffic signal-related tools, we aim to make the learning process engaging and relatable to practical scenarios.

## Goals

- **Learn Vue.js:** Gain a deeper understanding of Vue.js concepts, including components, directives, state management, routing, and more.
- **Explore Traffic Signal Concepts:** Apply Vue.js principles to simulate and manipulate traffic signal behaviors, timing, and controls.
- **Build Practical Tools:** Create functional traffic signal-related tools that can be used for educational purposes or as prototypes for future projects.
- **Iterative Development:** Continuously improve skills and knowledge by building a new tool each month, incorporating feedback, and experimenting with new techniques.
