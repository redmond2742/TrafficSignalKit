GPX2GeoJSON
===========

**Small and fast GPX to GeoJSON converter for JavaScript**

The main reason, why GPX2GeoJSON was created, is the [L.GeoJSON layer](https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/) of the [Leaflet interactive map library](https://leafletjs.com/). Having GPX2GeoJSON allows me to use both, GeoJSON and GPX, on the same map with the same layer and the exact same interfaces.

For a demonstration on how to use GPX on Leaflet maps, have a look at my [demo page](https://m-reimer.github.io/gpx2geojson/).

For more information on how to use GPX2GeoJSON, have a look at the [GPX2GeoJSON API reference](https://github.com/M-Reimer/gpx2geojson/wiki/GPX2GeoJSON-API-reference).
