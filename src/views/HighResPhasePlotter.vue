            Traffic signal controllers can collect data about the state of the
            controller including the signal states, detector states, timing
            plans and many other events. Arterial Traffic Signal Performance
            Measures (ATSPM) have been developed to help visualize this data.
            This tool uses the

              >Indiana Traffic Signal High Resolution Data Logger Enumerations. </a

            It ignores all the detection events (for now).
            <p>
              <br />
              Every 10th of a second (100 millisecond resolution) the controller
              can log the state of over 150 different aspects of the traffic
              signal. Enumerations numbers clearly state an event description
              and assigns a parameter number such as a Phase or Channel number
              to each event. Each event includes a timestamp of when this
              occured. Six Traffic controller vendors (in no particular order:
              Econolite, Siemens, Peek, McCain, Intelight and Trafficware) have
              incorporated standardized data logging enumerations. These can be
              transfered from the controller and converted to a Comma Seperated
              Value (CSV) file through a vendor defined process. That CSV file
              can be copied into this tool to see a split report.
